Adv: Cross-Browser Testing, high-level keywords
# Uses Playwright instead of Selenium Library (which uses Selenium WebDriver), providing more modern and robust capabilities.
Selenium Library Vs Browser Library: 
Performance:
Usual (Selenium): Selenium is powerful but can be slower and less stable with complex web applications.
Browser Library: Generally faster and more reliable, especially with dynamic and modern web applications.

Installation and Setup:
Usual (Selenium): Requires a WebDriver for each browser (e.g., chromedriver for Chrome).
Browser Library: Handles browser installation automatically, simplifying setup.

Feature Set:
Usual (Selenium): Limited support for newer web features like shadow DOMs or more sophisticated interaction capabilities.
Browser Library: Better support for modern web features, making it more suitable for contemporary web applications.

With Selenium:

You manually download chromedriver.exe for Chrome.
You specify the path to chromedriver.exe in your tests.
Selenium uses this executable to control the Chrome browser.
With Playwright (Browser Library):

Playwright automatically downloads the correct version of the browser binaries.
No need to manually manage or update these files.
Your tests can run on the latest browser versions without extra setup.
* browser binaries: executable files (.exe) that control the browser.
